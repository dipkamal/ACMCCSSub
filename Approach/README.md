# X-AID: Explanation based adversarial detection using feature attribution methods 

We provide two notebooks for collecting various statistical and non-statistical measures of benign and adversarial images for MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet. We only use measures from benign images to learn thresholds for our adversarial detectors. We use adversarial measures for visualization purposes.
