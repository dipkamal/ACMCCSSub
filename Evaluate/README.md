# X-AID: Explanation based adversarial detection using feature attribution methods 

Repository for the paper "X-AID: Explanation based adversarial detection using feature attribution methods" submitted at ACM CCS 2023. 

This paper provides our implmentation of various feature attribution based unsupervised adversarial detectors. We use integrated gradient method to extract various features of benign images and train three different detectors.

Each folder consists of implementation of each approach.
